# Encryption/Decryption Tool

This is a simple tool developed in Python that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using symmetric-key algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- cryptography library

You can install the required library using pip:

If you  are using Javascript file:
- `crypto`
- `readline`
## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.(javascript dependencies if you are running `main.js`)
3. Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
4. Run the script: `main.py` file
5. Follow the instructions in the command line interface:
   - Enter the message you want to encrypt.
   - The tool will generate a random key for encryption.
   - It will encrypt the message and display the encrypted text.
   - Then, it will decrypt the encrypted text using the same key and display the original message.

## Note

- Ensure that you securely manage the generated key for decryption purposes.
- This tool is for educational purposes and may require additional security measures for use in production environments.
